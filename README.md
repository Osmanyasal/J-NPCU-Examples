# J-NPCU-Examples
In this repository i'm going to implement the <b>'J-NPCU'</b> library to some parallelable problems.<br> 
As you may find the code in this repository i've also written a medium article about it.<br>
#### Here's examples and theirs medium articles.
* Finding frequency of a word 3.5x faster (https://osmyasal.medium.com/j-npcu-searching-words-3-5x-faster-a7f47fa713ba)
* Image processing pipeline 7x faster (https://osmyasal.medium.com/j-npcu-dynamic-image-processing-with-12x-speedup-9f5e386c0cc1)
